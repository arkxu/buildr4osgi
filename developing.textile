h1. Developing with Buildr4OSGi

Since Buildr4OSGi is a Buildr plugin, we get all the tooling coming with Buildr.

Run <code>rake -T</code> from the command line to see all the tools available.

h2. Running the specs

Let's not keep you waiting:

<code>rake coverage</code>

It will run all the specs AND will generate reports on the code coverage using rcov, available under _reports.

h2. Make a new release

Make sure the Github repository is set up as a Gem repository. By changing the version of the gem in the gemspec file, a new version of the gem will be issued next time you push your changes.

Alternatively, you can create a gem quickly by running:

<code>gem build buildr4osgi.gemspec</code>
